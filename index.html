            Quote1.png We must all live in the real world… and sometimes that world can be pretty grim. But it is the Dream… the hope… that makes the reality worth living. 
            In the early 1940s, I made a personal pledge to uphold the Dream… And as long as the Dream remains even partially unfulfilled, I cannot abandon it! 
            -Steve Rogers 
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">Cpt. Steven "Steve" Rogers a.k.a. Captain America the First Avenger,[27] was rejected by the U.S. Army during World War II due to numerous health problems. He ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth where he received the Super-Soldier Serum developed by Dr. Abraham Erskine. 
            The serum greatly enhanced his frail body to the peak of human physicality.[40] As the Sentinel of Liberty, alongside his best friend Bucky Barnes[39] and the Invaders</p>

        <p class="lb_text">
            "My friend, he told me that it was better to feel shitty from losing love than it is to never experience love and feel nothing at all. Feel empty. And I think he was right. Which is how I've been feeling for a long time. I push people away, kept them at a distance because of the fear of that loss, but I don't wanna do that anymore."
            - Mighty Thor
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited an ancient war between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power and hammer Mjølnir, and banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.</p>
